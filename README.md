## Parallel Convex-Hull solver

This application was designed to compare time complexity of convex hull problem in both parallel and sequential algorithms. The convex hull problem is solved based on the Graham's scan algorithm.

### Techniques used in this application:
* Parallelization using OpenMPI in C++
* Graphical visualization using C++ Graphics library (libgraph)
